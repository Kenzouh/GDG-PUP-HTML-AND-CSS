    <h2>About Me</h2><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        Hi! I'm Kenzo C. Ragundiaz, a student from BSIT 3-5 in PUP Main campus. I am 21 years old as of the 
        moment that I am coding this. I went to Bachelore of Science in Information Technology &lpar;IT&rpar;
        because I want to learn about the mysteries of the computer and softwares. I do wish to become a frontend
        web developer soon.
    </p><br/>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2><br/>

        <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">Motivational Speeches</h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">I want to be a host and a public speaker one day. I like motivating my group mates 
            whenever I am their leader in a group project.
        </p><br/>

        
        <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">Studying Different Cultures</h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">I'm mostly focused in studying Japanese cultures, but I do appreciate learning 
            different cultures from other countries as well.
        </p><br/>


        <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">Learning Japanese</h3>
    
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Another old hobby that I have was learning Japanese. I used to belong to 
                Japanese classes from 2020&ndash;2021, but, I got busy with school works. Therefore, I got no time 
                to learn it. I can still read Hiragana &lpar;ひらがな&rpar;, Katakana &lpar;カタカナ&rpar;, and some 
                N5 Kanji &lpar;漢字&rpar;.
            </p><br/>

            <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Japanese</h4>

            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">I love Japanese cultures and I like how polite the Japanese are. I would love to visit
                Sapporo, Hokkaido one day to enjoy the snow and shopping there, as well.
            </p><br/>

            <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Chinese &lpar;Simplified&rpar;</h4>

            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">I want to learn Chinese, so I can retain my Kanji knowledge.</p><br/>

            <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Korean</h4>

            <p style="margin-left: 60px;">I want to learn Korean, so I can retain my Japanese grammar skills and it'll be easier to 
                learn knowing both Chinese and Japanese.
            </p><br/>
